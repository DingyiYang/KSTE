[Are LLMs Smarter Than Chimpanzees? An Evaluation on Perspective Taking and Knowledge State Estimation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.12410)

## Overview
Cognitive anthropology suggests that the distinction of human intelligence lies in the ability to infer other individuals’ knowledge states and
understand their intentions. In comparison, our closest animal relative, chimpanzees, lack the capacity to do so. With this paper, we aim to evaluate LLM performance in **estimating other humans’ knowledge states and their potential actions**. We design two tasks: 
- IKD task: If LLMs can detect when story characters, through their actions, demonstrate knowledge they should not possess. 
- KNP task: If LLMs can predict story characters’ next actions based on their own knowledge vs. objective truths they do not know. (shown in figure below)

Results reveal that most current state-of-the-art LLMs achieve near-random performance on both tasks, and are substantially inferior to humans. We argue future LLM research should place more weight on the abilities of knowledge estimation and intention understanding.
